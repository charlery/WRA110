			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>	Behind many advancements in technology are a group of engineers that implore many different tactics to solve problems that we face today as a society. In order for these groups to function to their best ability, communication between each group member most be clear, concise, and accurate. If information cannot be spread around the group, tasks will not be accomplished when they are due. These groups usually have two different types of documents that are made to communicate to each other and to others. Communication between engineers usually consists of technical reports. These reports consists usually of the way a problem was solved, in extreme detail. Another way that information is communicated to others who are needed to understand information, but not in the same scale as the other engineers, engineers usually take on a simpler explanation of what is going on, and what it implies about how the problem is solved. With this communication great technologies can be developed from engineering teams and be spread around the globe for easing certain tasks for people everywhere. This deems technology important to the persons in the engineering field as it is a integral part of the engineering discipline. This piece of writing will be specifically focused on mechanical engineering and how a mechanical engineer can successfully communicate. </p>
