			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>As the music video begins a narration of a child worker from a diamond mine river starts to speak. The narrator begins on the lengthy hours they work mining diamonds and how they are under the “...watchful eyes of the soldiers...” who watch the children mine with their loaded weapons in arm. From this the narrator goes on the say “Everyday we fear for our lives...” which is illustrated by the children working diligently in complete silence even though they struggle to lift the pickaxes that they use to mine the diamonds. Finally the narrator begins talking about how they are enslaved by the rebels and were forced to murder their own family members for diamonds. The narrator end with the line “We are the children of the blood diamonds” with a close up of a child worker, however the child's pupils are heavily dilated. This is to illustrate the effect that cartoon animators give to characters when they see something bright and shinny, like a diamond. Since all the children do all day is mine diamonds the pupils of their eyes have permanently become adjusted to that size. The narrator repeats  “blood diamonds” over and over again while a jeweler examines diamonds, however even though the diamonds are blood or conflict diamonds, they do not look any different than any other diamond mined from another country. It is after all of this that the hook of the song begins, a Shirley Bassey sings that lines “Diamonds are forever. They won't leave in the night, I've no fear that they might desert me” while West walks around a wealthy-looking European city, the children crowd around each other in the dark and dusty mines in which they work. From the point of view of the children, these diamonds are the only thing that is there lives and the only reason why they are living today. It is often said that diamonds are a girls best friend, however for these children it seems like diamonds are their only friends because they have lost everything else to the rebels; their families, their childhood and innocence, and their freedom. In another part of the video a man is proposing to a woman and puts on a perfectly normal ring, while the woman is examining her new ring, he hand beings to shift into different poses and blood rushes from around her ring up to the entire length of arm. In a mirror off to the side of the room a child worker, with heavily dilated pupils, looks on with a blank stare unfazed by the horrific event occurring. This gives us a glimpse at how desensitized these child workers have become from the constant violent occurring around them. Another excerpt form the video shows another child worker with a diamond in their hand, their hand is then shown behind a jeweler's desk in a jewelery store. The jeweler takes the diamond from the child and hands it to the customer who unsuspectingly takes the diamond, however instead of taking the child's hand and bringing them up as well the jeweler leaves the child smiles at his business associate and stares unappealingly at the child. In another part of the video West says “They pray for the death of our dynasty like amen” a child worker is depicted with their hands in a praying motion while they are in the mining rivers, this only enforces the fact the the children want to leave the mining rivers and lead free lives, and they pray that the men who are controlling the rebels stop and let them free. In the final scene of West's video he is driving and sees a child worker riding with him in his back seat. He jumps out the car and rolls away while his car hits a panel of glass, shattering it. The shattered glass around the car looks like diamonds and the child worker in the back was almost trying to scare West out of the car so that he wouldn't need to see these glass “diamonds”. West then runs with a group of children workers into a safe haven, a church. This whole scene shows that if the children who work in the mines could intervene and stop people from buying these conflict diamonds then they would do what ever it takes. </p>
