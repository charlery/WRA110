			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers defines mechanical engineering as “creat[ing] and develop[ing] mechanical systems for all of humankind. Concerned with the principles of force, energy and motion, mechanical engineers use their knowledge of design, manufacture, and operational processes to...enhanc[e] safety, economic vitality and enjoyment throughout the world.”(“What Is a Mechanical Engineer”) This definition of mechanical engineering encompasses the discipline because it includes information of principles of science that is used to advance technologies around the world. Mechanical engineers, in addition to science classes, use mathematics to make calculations that are needed for a certain task or that simplify a task. Another critical skill needed for mechanical engineering as well as any engineering  discipline is problem solving; this skill is important as a method to complete a problem is needed before anything can be calculated or projected. With all of these skills a mechanical engineer can work in many different job titles in many different industries to problem solve. Overall, mechanical engineers work using science and mathematics skills to solve critical problems to an organization. Typically mechanical engineers work at automotive, aerospace, electronics, nanotechnology, and even entertainment industries, as well as many more. With a plethora of choices for a work environment, mechanical engineers can find work helping to identify and attempt to find an answer to a problem. It is often told to many undergraduate engineering students that engineers help solve problems by utilizing mathematics and science as a way to quantify or correctly solve a problem that is faced. </p>
