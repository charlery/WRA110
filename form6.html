			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Research is critical to mechanical engineers because it can be used to further technology and create new methods of completing tasks. Research can take many different form in the mechanical engineering industry, one such example is an article written about technologies that were being used by formula racing engineering teams to improve the aerodynamics of the vehicles they were racing. The engineers utilized  many different things to improve aerodynamics, one program that stuck out was called Computervision’s StressLab. This program allows for a three-dimensional model of a part of a formula car to be tested for stresses that may destroy a part or make it malfunction. This test can also be preformed on models of the suspension of the vehicle. “Dynamic analysis enables [ the engineers] to calculate the motion of all parts, including mass effects and the forces acting on systems. By learning more about how [the vehicle] respond[s] to different variables, teams can more accurately predict handling under specific racing conditions.” (“Hugging the Track “) The formula car engineering team uses this system to , like stated in the quotation, predict how the vehicle will react. However during a formula racing season, the team will race on numerous tracks, the vehicle needs to be more readily equipped with the suspension that is desired for a specific race track. “...suspension settings change from track to track; if the [suspension] system is not perfectly tuned, that can cost a team the race”(“Hugging the Track”). From this example of formula race engineers devising multiple vehicle set ups for each track that is raced one, they optimize the vehicle to operate to its full potential and purpose; to get around corners quickly will maintaining grip and winning races. Without the research and development that went into the aerodynamics of the vehicle, the formula team would not have as good of a chance of winning its races than before. It shows that with research, especially in the mechanical engineering discipline, an operation can be optimized for efficiency and performance. Although there are certainly many more representations of mechanical engineering research opportunities that have lead to many new technologies, research can be optimizing a vehicle to perform better than before. </p>
