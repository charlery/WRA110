		<h1>Technology Chose My Major</h1>
			<p>In the fall of 2011 that my high school started the college selection process with me. A guidance counselor and I sat down for a meeting about my academic future, and what I wanted to become later on in life. This was surprising to me because I did not even know what I wanted to do with my life yet. The counselor told me that over the weekend I should just hang out and do things that I liked to do and maybe something will pop up. So that weekend I just did what I always did; I researched and watched videos on cars that I thought were interesting. When I came back to the guidance office I told my counselor that I wanted to make cars, she said that I probably wanted to be in a profession where they designed things that we use every day, like engineering. </p>

	<p>The discipline that I was attracted to, automotive engineering, focus on creating a working, efficient, cost effective version of vehicles that the automotive designers have created. Usually they are divided into teams to tackle a different part of the vehicle, they also have teams assembled to do tests on the vehicle, create different ways of manufacturing parts, and layout of the vehicle to name a few. The process of designing and testing a vehicle can take a while because of all the improvements that each team attributes to the vehicle. However with trial and error each group can accomplish its goals for the vehicle. </p>

	<p>The main way the researched information about cars was through the internet. Through the internet I was able to learn look up car manufacturers that interested me. At first I would just look then up to see they have a drag race or to see a nice paint job, but after a while I became interested in how people made these same cars faster. I researched many modifications that car enthusiasts made to their cars in an effort to make them faster. This then translated to my yearning interest to learn how these additions worked, and how they made these cars faster without creating problems. This lead to many hours looking up how these different parts worked. I was amazed by the ideas that other people came up with to make a part of the car perform better. While I was doing theses things I still had questions in my mind about how all these systems of a car work together to move itself efficiently from point to point. The connection between each system of the car was something that you could only visualize unless there was a diagram of a couple of systems working together. While reading online forums about car problems that people shared, I made the connections between systems. When part of a system went wrong, it usually affected another system of the vehicle. It was then that I realized the importance of each part of the vehicle and the importance of everything working successfully together. </p>

	<p>The only way I was able to connect these systems of the vehicle was through the internet. The internet was one of my only tools for find any information that I needed. The good thing about using the internet was that the information that I read was always up to date that lead me to understand how fast the industry changed. What was seen as innovative six months ago, would now be added to every vehicle in a companies lineup to compete with other companies. I would wait for automotive shows to post information on the new concept cars and research what everything from the compression ratio to the weight of the car meant to make that car better. Along with researching I would meet up with people who had the same passion for cars as I did, and we would just discuss everything, this is what I did for the majority of the time. It became such a prevalent aspect in my life that my parents would go crazy whenever I talked about cars. That just added to the fire and eventually if I wanted to annoy my parents all I had to do was say a car term. </p>

	<p>The biggest thing I remember researching was around 2007 when Nissan stated that it was releasing a successor to the highly acclaimed Nissan Skyline. The Skyline was an amazing car because of it's expert handling in the corners and its amazing acceleration. When the successor of the Skyline, the Nissan GT-R, was released with complete specifications, it truly amazed the entire industry. I read many articles that analyzed the engineering that went into making such an automotive monster. The many descriptions of the tests and the different methods that all culminated to the success of the vehicle were great to read up on, and many were taken directly from project engineers that worked closely with the product. Many online automotive shows would test the GT-R against exotic sports cars such as Lamborghini and Ferrari, but the GT-R either matched or beat these same cars in performance while being under $90,000. The GT-R was the first car the I truly tried to learn everything about. The information that was provided was incredibly interesting to me, and I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have the internet as a resource for research. </p>

	<p>When I finally decided that I wanted to pursue engineering as a major and career, I looked for the top engineering colleges in the United States, but more importantly, colleges that had a major connection to the automotive industry. Michigan State stood out to me because it had a strong engineering school as well as a strong connection to the automotive industry. However, if I ever decided to go into a different disciple of engineering, I would be able to due to the strength of the engineering college. As a first-year student here, I can safely say that the opportunities presented to me already have been excellent for my pursuit to the automotive industry. The engineering classes here challenge you to think in complex and unique ways in order to complete a given task. This fits me well as I am a person who likes to take on challenges and try and solve them. </p>

	<p>What I didn't know was that by looking and researching automotive news online was that I would develop a true passion for cars and car manufacturers that I had never experienced before. When I look back at all the times I spend online looking up silly things about cars, I look back at those times smiling because I realize that it was at those times that I developed a passion for engineering and made fundamental concepts about mechanical behind moving systems. Without the internet and its power of information I don't know where I would have ended up other than at Michigan State University studying mechanical engineering. It won't be easy, and there will be days that I will regret picking this major, but I will just keep my eyes on the prize. Obtaining a career at an automotive company designing vehicles. </p>
