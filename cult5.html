			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>One viable solution to the problem that is posed in Sierra Leone is involvement of the global community and allies to Sierra Leone. The United Nations can make guidelines for countries who have a significant diamond mining industry like Sierra Leone to follow. These could include setting up a review committee for global diamond trading and having random checks of working conditions of randomly selected mines. If the mines do not pass certain criteria or an examiner cannot enter a work site unharmed or without being threatened then the country that it occurs in would lose some aid that it receives from the United Nations or a major ally of that country that is apart of the United Nations Council. The criteria for the mines would have to include parameters on violence and working hours. Also if it is uncovered that any army is using children or anyone considered underage as soldiers to fight in the army, then that country would also lose funding and depending on the circumstances troops from outside the country may be used to stop any army using children soldiers. I believe that through this method, Sierra Leone will be able to bounce back from its civil unrest and democracy will be restored for all its citizens.</p>
