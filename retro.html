	ver the duration of the last four months  the Writing, Rhetoric & American Cultures class, section 110, has brought out certain elements of my writing and added certain elements as well. Each writing assignment that was assigned attacked an aspect of my writing that I had successfully hid during my high school writing classes. This attack on my writing weakness caused made my mistakes while writing obvious when doing revisions. Along with my improved writing skills, my revision skills also improved. This is due to the fact that my revision process consists of two processes, the first for grammatical errors, and another for completeness of the ideas that are being stated and overall flow of the paper. Through this course it is evident that the more time and energy put into the revisions, the more likely the writing as a whole we become better. After during this process on the first two assignments, I began to mentally “revise” a paper while in the process of actually writing the assignment. A subsequent result of that was improved grammar and vocabulary, this enhances a piece of writing by allowing the reader to better visualize the information being presented. The vocabulary that I utilized has greatly increased as the semester progressed. From all of these improvements, my writing skills have risen from constantly attempting to improve my writing assignments. As stated before, each assignment build upon each other and allowed for a better overall writing experience. 

	The first writing assignment that we were given was about how we chose our major and what career path we intended to take. This is an exercise to show how we could prove how we chose our major and how that integrated into our ambitions later in life. The most difficult part of this project was connecting the major with the career goal as it may not be quite evident how they connected. Another difficult section of this assignment was giving the reason why you chose your major. Through all of these small obstacles the paper overall was quite easy and required little to no revision in order to be considered complete. Advise on this paper to students taking this course would be to layout how you want to paper to flow. After I had written the entire assignment I realized that there were many parts that did not make sense. This could have easily been avoided by utilizing the technique previously stated. This assignment was meant to bring the student into writing by utilizing some organizational techniques and simple revision techniques. I really enjoyed the assignment and reflecting on how I choose my major really reminded me of the goal of my education here at Michigan State University, and how grateful I am being able to further my education.  

	The second assignment was a bit more difficult than the first as it was had to be longer and we had to choose which topic we wanted to write about. When you selected your topic that you wanted the paper become a bit harder as it was evident that more analytical writing was required to completely address all the aspects of your specific paper. The writing became harder due to the amount of information that had to be researched and analyzed was massive. The questions posed by the writing topic were very good and help with finding ways to fill out your paper, without adding fluff or nonsense to it. I personally did my paper on Kanye West's music video “Diamonds from Sierra Leone”. I choose this video because the amount of corruption in the diamond industry. I went on to talk about how the diamonds were being used, and what the real purpose of the diamond industry was to Sierra Leone. Selecting a topic for this paper is the most important step, because the entire writing assignment can be completed easily if the topic has meaning and background information. This paper prepared you for the upcoming research paper by having you find information on the issue or topic for this paper. From researching a selected topic on a problem facing society today, I learned that the media portrays current events in nearly everything it produces. Thus, giving the public insight on currents events that they may not have knowledge about. I definitely learned that in music especially, people speak their minds so that others may hear what they have to say about a certain topic, just like Kanye West. 

	The third assignment was the most difficult of the previous two assignments as this was a research paper that required many resources and analysis of the resources that you used. For this paper you wrote about how professionals in your field of study communicated with each other. It was difficult to obtain all of the necessary information that was needed for the communication aspect of the paper, but if you found a professor or some working in the field that you were pursing, then you could get a first hand account of how communication was used in the industry. Linking how professionals in an industry communicated to how objectives were completed in their field was a bit difficult, but through reasoning they could be linked quite successfully. Although this was the longest assignment that was due for this class it was not difficult to complete the word requirement, this was mainly due to the depth at which each topic needed to be covered. There needed to be large amounts of writing to completely convey the idea proposed. After completing this assignment it was evident that when an instructor creates an assignment that has a large word count, you will only be able to complete it if your research on the assignment's topic is in depth. Otherwise, you may struggle to complete the word count, which may end with filler sentences and paragraphs that contribute nothing to the overall topic of the assignment. This was the most insightful assignment during this course and really is the focal point of how this course improves your writing and grammatical skills.

	The last project that worked on was a documentary about one of the other papers that we had completed before. This is easy to do as most of the work had been completed before, so what the most difficulty part of this project was editing videos and finding relevant interviews to use in the documentary. The team that you are assigned in the most integral part of this project as a team that does not communicate well will not be able to complete all the tasks that you are supposed to. However since the teams were assigned randomly, another aspect of this assignment was to improve our group skills and how we handled situations in which other may not do their part. Although all of the group members of each respective group added their part in the project, in other classes or even in the industry that one may be employed at, there may be individuals who do not complete their assigned task which may lead to an unsatisfactory result for the group. Being able to work through adversity in a group is an integral part of how objectives are completed. For this project, the most adverse part would be the collection and editing of the videos. Each group member added their own part to the video; whether it was through video editing or addition of video clips, photos, or writing. While editing the video and writing that were to be presented in the video, we soon realized that a seven to eight minute limit on the video length was not was long as we previously thought. This project really allowed each group to dive into the selected topic and present a video that covered the core of the topic effectively. 

	Overall this course was excellent as it allowed my writing skills to improve and the students in the class came to together to solve tasks . One of the most prolific examples of this would be adding content to the websites that we must continuously update. When starting this class it seemed that nobody really knew the process by which a website was created and maintained. We learned through online sources about HTML, a coding language that allows the user to build a website, and how to obtain a desired effect through methods which you knew how to complete. An example of this would be, adding a background image while still being able to read the information being presented on a page. I worked with a couple of students to figure out different ways in which we could complete that task using the methods we learned through this course. This course is a wonderful way for all incoming students to standardize the way they write and communicate. Through this course it is evident that improvements made to writing skills can help in many other subjects that are taken by students. Along with the technological aspect of this course, I would highly recommend this course to any student.</p>
