	      <h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Through the sanctions taken by the United Nations and allies of Sierra Leone the amount of violence that takes place in the diamond mines will dramatically decrease over time. Along with the decrease in violence, less military action will be needed and soldiers from the rebel army could be released as they are not needed for the rebels to democratically take over the government. A less violent change of power and organized elections would restore some order to the country and the country could finally start benefiting off the enormous resource of diamonds that are is under its soil. This could also be a good opportunity to look at other countries that have diamonds as a major export and see if they have are treating the workers with dignity. If it is found that these countries are violating global diamond mining rules similar sanctions could be placed on the country until they have no choice but to control their diamond industry or face national devastation. Through this the tainted diamonds of the world would become less traded and eventuality all diamonds would be mined under humane and comfortable conditions. Only under these conditions can diamonds be traded humanely and no one will be exploited for their diamonds or for their work.</p>
