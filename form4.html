			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>As previously stated, communication is a important of a mechanical engineers job. This is due to the team or group of engineers depending on each other to bring ideas and effectively inform the entire group. The types of communication can range from sketches and approximations to finished technical reports. Michigan State University engineering professor, Timothy Hinds, says that communication between other engineers more commonly occurs by the use of email, this communication he says is usually for putting together pieces needed for the solution that is agreed by the group.(Hinds) Emailing other engineers on the project data that has been newly generated is much faster and simpler than printing the information and mailing or delivering it, especially when distance between each team member is very large. 
	Diagrams, sketches, approximations, and estimates in the early phase of design are made by an engineer to explain a solution that the engineer deems plausible to complete the objective. These diagrams, sketches, approximations, and estimates are a type of visual communication between each team member, showing a planned solution to a problem with these visual guides can effectively translate to other team members the intention of a design. During one of his freshman engineering seminars about prototyping, Timothy Hinds specifically spoke about how prototyping is one of the most integral parts of turning an idea into something that can be produced to solve a problem. “Every idea that seems feasible should begin its materialization by either a sketch, approximation, estimation, or a diagram, all of these are great ways to start off an idea”(Hinds).
	One of the last and major ways that engineers communicate information to each other is by technical reports. These technical reports are essentially the entire project that a team or a single engineer was tasked to do, and how the team or the engineer went about completing the task. These reports are the most formal way of presenting information to another engineer and are usually reserved for the end of a project. Engineering professor Timothy Hinds stated that these technical reports are often a complete overview of a project and usually are produced to show to other engineers how a project was made and what the fundamental ideas behind the design were(Hinds). When a technical report is written, the language that is utilized by the engineer writing is meant to be direct, clear, and informative. All three of these ideals lead to the technical report being packed with specific information about the project, often many measurements are included into a technical report to give the reader better visualization of the subject at hand. Technical reports are to be so precise and accurate that Hinds says “...another engineer should be able to replicate your project strictly from reading the technical report”(Hinds).An excerpt from a technical report completed by a team of undergraduate first-year engineering students at Michigan State University shows the extent of directness and clearness that is expected from a technical report:</p>
		
<p>The color sensor was used to detect the white line on the black ground of the test course. It was placed directly in front of the wheels facing the ground with a quarter of an inch between the ground and the sensor. The robot is programed to alternate moving each wheel forward quickly when it senses the white line in order to follow it. The third major aspect for the NXT robot is the lift mechanism used to lift the load from the ground, this is demonstrated in Figure B. A motor is mounted in the mid front of the robot, with a long dowel going through the motor output shaft. Attached to the shaft are long pieces of Lego block connectors that reach the ground and run parallel with the ground for four inches. For the stabilization of the load there are two side arms that holding it while under the lift. A ultrasonic sensor is mounted above the entire apparatus, connected by clamps to the motor, and pointed at a forty-five degree angle at the ground, as demonstrated in Figure A. When the ultrasonic sensor detects the load the lift mechanism will lift the load up. The last major part of the robot is the color sensor used to detect the light source on the wall, shown in Figure A. It is mounted perpendicularly to the light sensor on the right side of the robot; this allows it to see the light source on the wall. This was done by just connecting the color sensor to the light sensor's stabilization brick. (Mitchell, Jett, Charlery, Filarski)</p>

<p>From the example above, the writer used specific information on each part of the project. This would allow for another group of students to read over this report and begin to formulate ideas on how to complete a similar project.
	Using these types of communication for mechanical engineers are also the base types of communications that other engineering disciplines utilize. With all these types of communications that were discussed a major form of communication is often overlooked; Talking. All of the types of communications that were discussed earlier stem from just having a conversation with members in an engineering group. It is the most basic but evidently the most successful form of communication between engineers. With it being the most direct form of communication listed, it can easily be the most useful and most readily used by most engineers. With all these types of communication help these engineers to successfully and fully complete a task that is given to them.</p>
