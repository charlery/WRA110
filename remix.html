		<p>The topic that our group chose to pursue was Photo-manipulation or more commonly referred to as “Photo-shopping” and Body Image, this was decided because a team member had just recently completed a research paper on the topic. Consequently, composing the information needed for the documentary was not extremely difficult. With the plethora of information available during the creation of this documentary, it really opened your eyes and mind to the amount of photo manipulation that we see in advertisements with models. As a result of all the information that we gathered for the documentary we had a bit of difficulty choosing the best information to illustrate the main points of our argument. Our group wanted the audience to feel that they knew insider information on our topic, so the information used was facts and interviews that we did not find many other sources utilizing. Our group went through the entire layout of the documentary to find the best spots for the information that we used. We went through each section of the documentary and added or removed information or portions of interviews to better illustrate our documentary's objective. The most vital resources that we sued in our documentary were the recorded interviews, these interviews gave us insight on how people thought these pictures looked without them having to withhold themselves. They spoke what they thought about the pictures and it evidently showed the audience the motives behind modeling agencies manipulating their models photographs. On the other hand, the search engines that we used to find information, YouTube and Google, were surprising our least beneficial resources. This was due to the amount of information that each possesses on our topic. There was too much information for our group to handle within the time constrains and some of the information was either unreliable or irrelevant to our specific topic of Photo-manipulation and Body Image. From doing research for this project, it is evident that using these types of search engines, whether it be Google, YouTube, Bing, or Yahoo, is not the most effective way of obtaining reliable data or information needed for research. They are however wonderful starting points for an introduction into a topic you are concerned with. The communication between each member in our group was extremely efficient. Our group only had discussions on the project and topics pertaining to the project while we met, this was great because we could accomplish many tasks without having to have many meetings. Working in a group for this project was useful because we could split up tasks among our group members. This enabled each group member to get a job which best utilized their skills. Our group tried to plan out how each part of the documentary would be completed, and even had dates by which we wanted to have certain parts of the documentary or research information completed. With this tactic that our group employed for this project, given more time to complete the project our group could have had more interviews with experts in the field and active models. There could also be better collection of interviews , better video editing, and better video quality and shooting. Cupped with professional transitions between scenes, the final product would be a bit more in-depth and could better unveil the whole topic of our group. The designs that out group utilized were not over the top, however the slides that contained writing that moved up the scene added an interesting aspect of our documentary, giving viewers something that they had seen before in more popular movies, such as Star Wars. We decided as a team on which designs would better fit the type of mood we wanted to create in the documentary, which lead to the entire group adding their opinion of a certain design that was chosen.  </p>
