                        <h2> Blog post #2</h2>
                        <p>The video was targeted at people who play World of Warcraft, or anyone who plays an online game.</p>
                        <p>The video showed that once you start playing the game, you no longer want to do anything else. You waste your time playing this game and no doing other things that need to be done.</p>
                        <p>The creators view on obsessive online gaming was that you end up wasting your time doing something that in the end truly has no real meaning other than to have fun, I find that opinion to be quite true as well/</p>
