                        <p><strong>1. the purpose of the video</strong><br>The purpose of the video was show thorugh a poem that no matter how bad a situation is, it always gets better.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. how the video attempts achieve its purpose</strong><br />The author of the video told his story about how he left his wife becuas ehe was gay, and how his uncle did the same thing.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. the structure of the message</strong><br /> The author fomatted the message in a poem.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. how this video's structure can help you revise your Lived Experiences project</strong><br /> I don't think I could really change my essay to become a poem but that is a option that I could pursue.</p>

                        <p>The video was targeted at people who play World of Warcraft, or anyone who plays an online game.</p>
                        <p>The video showed that once you start playing the game, you no longer want to do anything else. You waste your time playing this game and no doing other things that need to be done.</p>
                        <p>The creators view on obsessive online gaming was that you end up wasting your time doing something that in the end truly has no real meaning other than to have fun, I find that opinion to be quite true as well/</p>

                        <p>The voice used in the the ad sounded rugid but still had a sense of officalness about it. The narrorator spoke about how everyone thinks that Detroit is a terrible place to be, however the images that were shown in the commerical give the city a sense of hardwork, togethernesss, and determination. The statue of the Iron fist with smoke raising from the ground around it conveyed the point that the commerical was portraying; Detroit is a harkworking city that is on the rise. The final words that were seen on the screen were "Imported from Detriot" however each word was faded into the screen one at a time so that you could not tell where the car was imported from. I believe that this helped the viewer realize that Chrysler, Ford, and GM are serious about improving thier cars public view and are focused on how each vehicle is precived by the public.</p>

<p>This is a reflection on the first writing assignment of the year. This writing assignment wasn't too hard as it was just a basic question, but it has been a while since I've written an essay. This is definitely a wake up call, because my writing isn't that great and I need to improve it so that I can write proficiently. As I finished that paper I realized that I dislike writing a lot, to the point where I don't even want to think about anything else except when this course will end. That isn't to say that I dislike the professor, I just don't like writing. At all. </p>
<h2 style="color: White"> Blog post #5</h2>
<p>I was looking on the WRA department website and noted that these first year courses are intended to supplement your writing and improve it to a proficient standard while in college. This gives my writing hope as I would like to make my writing better so that I can communicate through writing. I think that if my high school English teachers and tried to improve my grammar and vocabulary while in their courses I may have been a little better at writing and not always dread writing assignments. However, I see what the purpose of this course really is; to improve a first-year students writing skills. </p>

<p>This week I decided to complete a majority of the “Code Academy” and that really helped in further understanding HTML and CSS coding. I really wish I had learned HTML before I entered this course as I can see that it is very useful and can translate to understanding other coding languages better. The only other code that I have done is Visual Basic. It was difficult at first but as the course progressed the projects became more manageable but required more complex code to successfully achieve that project's objective. I hope that learning HTML will help in completing more complex languages that I may have to learn in other courses.  </p>

<p>After finishing the Cultural Analysis Assignment I believe that this course will definitely be better than I previously thought. I liked that fact that the topic wasn't chosen by the professor and that the students each had the opportunity to select that paper that they believed they would sussed the best with. This definitely boosted my writing skills as I made some comparisons and used vocabulary that I would have never used previously in my writing. What really made this interesting was that the topics that other students choose were interesting and I even read a couple because I just wanted to see what others wrote theirs on. </p>

<h2 style="color: White"> Blog post #8</h2>
<p>This week the annotated bibliography was due at midnight. I completed it before the week had even begun, however I don't think that the sources that I used will be the most useful resources and maybe I will have to find more. It is hard to find information that would better the argument of the paper and I feel as though I can't really demonstrate my point extremely well. I started the paper and it is hard to keep on elaborate on the topic at hand because the information and resources that I used don't seem to match up that well. What I didn't expect from this paper was my inability to even comprehend that entire picture of the essay I'm writing. I have to find better ways to outline my assignments so that I don't run into this problem for future writing assignments; in this class and future classes as well.

<p>This week is Spring break and I am visiting companies around Michigan that are very interesting. This week I will visit General Motors, Ford, Dow Chemical, Whirlpool, and many others. Today we visited Miejer and one thing that they emphasized was the ability to effective communicate to team members. I think that the Formal Research Project is a perfect depiction of what communication needs to happened between professionals in any industry. It incredible how the things that you learn in classes, in any level of education, can come out around you in everyday things.</p>

<p>I have no idea what I'm supposed to be putting down for these journal entries. I wish there was some sort of guide to see how to put these together instead of just trying to come up with information on your ow. Maybe that is why we write these with no instruction, I t gives us the ability to think creatively and make what we are writing about as creative as possible while sticking to the subject. Then why wouldn't the instructor tell us that we are supposed to be writing creatively in stead of telling us that these are blog entries? Maybe some question will never be answered. I guess that will be my entry for this week then. </p>

<h2 style="color: White"> Blog post #11</h2>
<p>Each week these blogs are getting harder and harder to write because there is nothing to write about. I wish that more exciting things happened during class. Maybe if we had random dance sessions or maybe we were able to come to class via Skype, maybe the class would be a bit more exciting. That isn't to say that the teacher isn't doing a good job teaching, the class is just over too quickly. What I really want is to find a way to do my CodeAcademy quicker so that I can get it over with, I like coding but CodeAcademy isn't that fun.  </p>

<h2 style="color: White"> Blog post #12</h2>
<p>This week we start working with our groups for the final class project. I like my group members and I know that they will work hard to finish this project. I wish that this class was a bit longer. I don't think that we wrote enough, which is weird because I don't like writing, but there were only four writing assignments and I believe that there should be more. I feel very weird saying that, and I know that if I saw this while I was in high school I would have been angry. I'm still a bit angry though, I just want to be done with this entry. </p>

<h2 style="color: White"> Blog post #13</h2>
<p>This week we have started filming for the project and I think that it is going to be fine. I though before that it would be hard to find information on the topics, however through research it became quite evident that information would be easy to find. The most difficult thing about this project is the editing of the video, since none of us have edited a video before we have to look up how to edit videos. The program that we are using is imovie, and it is pretty simple to use so it won't be hard to find something online to help us understand the program. </p>

<h2 style="color: White"> Blog post #14</h2>
<p> This is the final journal entry, I really like that I don't have to post anymore. Although these were very useful because they helped with creativity, I really wish that these were shorter or had less of them. Overall this class was useful and I can see why this course is required for nearly all incoming students. It really helps with writing better and hopefully that will allow for higher grades in subsequent classes. </p>
