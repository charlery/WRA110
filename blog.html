                        <p><strong>1. the purpose of the video</strong><br>The purpose of the video was show thorugh a poem that no matter how bad a situation is, it always gets better.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. how the video attempts achieve its purpose</strong><br />The author of the video told his story about how he left his wife becuas ehe was gay, and how his uncle did the same thing.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. the structure of the message</strong><br /> The author fomatted the message in a poem.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. how this video's structure can help you revise your Lived Experiences project</strong><br /> I don't think I could really change my essya to become a poem but that is a option that I could pursue.</p>

                        <p>The video was targeted at people who play World of Warcraft, or anyone who plays an online game.</p>
                        <p>The video showed that once you start playing the game, you no longer want to do anything else. You waste your time playing this game and no doing other things that need to be done.</p>
                        <p>The creators view on obsessive online gaming was that you end up wasting your time doing something that in the end truly has no real meaning other than to have fun, I find that opinion to be quite true as well/</p>
