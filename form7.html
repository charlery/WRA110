			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>With all the communication that occurs in the mechanical engineering profession, an early or perspective engineering student should realize that not only does a passion for mathematics and the sciences really help in engineering classes, an ability to successfully communicate information to others is also something that students should be about to do, to some extent. Communication has played large roles in engineering group projects and exercises that occur in early engineering classes. This also occurs in the industry as mechanical engineers, as well as all other engineering disciplines, have to communicate with other engineers as well as other professionals that would work within an organization. Communication can consist of many forms in engineering, from drawings and sketches to formal technical reports about an entire project. While most communication occurs with email, drawing and sketches, formal technical reports are also great ways to communicate to team members what is occurring with an engineering project. Technical reports can give insight to how a project was completed and what the fundamental ideas were that contributed to the project. Overall communication is a valuable asset to have and is important for any engineering discipline, including mechanical engineering as well. Communication skills lead a mechanical engineer to be able to execute the solution to the problem that needs to be solved. In solving the problem there is usually technology involved with the process, and sometimes new technologies will be the end product of a project. As stated before technology is an integral part of the mechanical engineering process and many advancements made in the industry are made due to the use of technology, sometimes in a different and innovative way. Many industries depend on technology for advancements in their industry and mechanical engineering is no different than any other. Everywhere that a mechanical engineer works, they use the technologies available in the industry to solve the problem they face. Most technologies that are used are computer based, however many advancements in the automotive industry have been physical. Turbochargers, sequential gear boxes, and the full carbon fiber chassis are examples of such physical advancements. These technologies would not have come into play for any engineer or any person working in the industries if there was not a group of engineers researching new technologies on a constant basis. While researching may not be one of the most desirable occupations for new or aspiring engineering students, it is a important part of the cycle in which research supplies the technologies used by engineers which then allows for advancements in processes and solving of problems. Solving problems is the ultimate goal in working as a mechanical engineer, and while it may be difficult to master the mathematics and sciences that need to be completed while attending school, it is also important that a new or aspiring engineering student learns to communicate, work well in teams, try new ideas, and develop new ways to tackle problems that may be faced. Becoming an engineer is not an easy task, as is trying to do any job professionally, but ambition, determination, and hard work are undoubtedly needed to make the process a bit easier. </p>
