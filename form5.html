			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Technology is fundamental to mechanical engineering and the engineering practice as a whole. Many of the advancements that we have today have used old technology to create new technologies. Mechanical engineers use many technologies that are found today to create things that are then turned into new technologies. Concepts of current or old technologies are often used in the creation of these new technologies. One example of technology that has been used by mechanical engineers to create newer technologies is Simulation Software. Simulation software that was developed by computer science engineers, was used by automotive engineers at many major automotive manufacturers as a way of testing out ideas and concepts for vehicles without having to spend money to build these concepts or ideas(“Simulation Software Getting Bigger”). This gives the automotive engineers the ability to make more efficient vehicles with out using money unnecessary. An example of a commonly used simulation software that is used today is the program AutoCAD. This technology has been used to create many diagrams that outline details for a particular program. Another way that technology is being used to help mechanical engineers is the use of everyday technology such as applications from a mobile software application store. These applications can simplify mundane things for mechanical engineers, so that they can use the information to complete a task. One such example is a application called Wolfram Alpha, this application can be used to calculate many things needed in mathematics very simply and quite conveniently as well. This application is even used by undergraduate students to quickly recheck an answer that they have previously calculated. But with this technology engineers can approximate and estimate on a project that needs an estimation quickly. Further, this shows that technology from anywhere can be used to improve something else, and that engineers use technology from anywhere to find a way to solve a problem that needs to be fixed. Without technology in the mechanical engineering industry, there would not be advancements and new discoveries. </p>
