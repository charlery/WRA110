			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p> Although it may seem like the most pressing issue is the use of child workers in a dangerous and violent workplace, that it not the true issue taking place or at least not the only issue. However the use of child workers were not as prominent as the use of child soldiers by the rebel army, Revolutionary United Front or more commonly known as R.U.F. The whole issue started when a group of Sierra Leoneans started an uprising to the government of Sierra Leone. Their leader, Foday Sankoh known as an unfriendly and violent leader, started the Revolutionary United Front to combat the government, however since the government did not want to leave power to the rebel forces. The R.U.F. started to take over diamond mining rivers starting from the eastern side of the country and began exporting the diamonds to fund the purchase of weapons for the rebels. Sankoh's soldiers would drive into villages and terrorize the occupants until they got what they wanted. This could be women, money, diamonds that the village mined, or more soldiers for the rebel army. The soldiers would take children from their homes and train them in to operate in the rebel army, from there these child soldiers would be taken to do various tasks such as watch over diamond workers or take over villages. The treatment of the diamond workers and the child soldiers were extremely brutal and many were killed by the rebel soldiers. The R.U.F. then went on to take over most of Sierra Leone and nearly took over the entire country before being pushed back by the government. The rebel army was able to make a huge amount of profit from the diamonds by limiting the amount of diamonds that were allowed to be sold from the jeweler companies across the globe, many of whom bought diamonds from Sierra Leone therefore indirectly funding the R.U.F. Thus, the real issue from this whole conflict was the rebel army, R.U.F. , and their brutality that caused the world to get a peek into the civil unrest that occurred in Sierra Leone.</p>
